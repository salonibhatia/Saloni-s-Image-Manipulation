When I first started this project, I was unsure of how to make a variety of colors with the image and I only started off by making about four or five. With the knowledge that I have obtained over this semester, I have learned how to use the different variables in the program and how to use math in programs. The two main variables that are used are 'myImage' and 'originalImage'. 'myImage' is used for  changing the image and 'originalImage' is used if the user wants to go back to the image with no color. With the knowledge I have now, I can change the value of these variables. Something else that I have a better grasp on now, is functions. As you can see, there were less functions because I did not know how to use them as well as I do now. I added more functions that allow me to change the color of the image and the program can do more than just change the color a couple of times. The main part that I took away was variables. When I first started coding, I did not have the best understanding of variables, but after adding more to this program I am now more comfortable with working with variables.
